    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In February 11th, we had our 2nd RUB, and the subject was 3D printing.
We invited two experts we have in the Roscoff Station (Sébastien and Sébastien).
One of them is in charge of the 3D printer of the Station and is able to design 3D models to help scientists, divers etc.
The other Sébastien made use of 3D printing for outreaching: he acquired 3D images of marine plankton and printed them, to show the diversity of marine microorganisms (and those are really nice).</p>

<p>In this RUB we briefly talked about the principles of 3D printing (everything is on the few <a href="https://github.com/rub-hub/rub01/slides/slides_rub01.pdf">slides</a> we presented).
Then we discussed how we could use this technology in the scientific context of the marine station.
We thought about some designs for outreaching, lab work, etc.</p>

<p>All the resources can be found in the RUB&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/rub-hub/rub01">Github repository</a>!</p>
