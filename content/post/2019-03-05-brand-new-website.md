Here's the first post of a new website, greatly inspired by the [inSileco](http://insileco.github.io/) blog.

To know how it was implemented, I suggest you to read the really nice [blog post](https://insileco.github.io/2018/03/30/hugo-github-travis-a-step-in-continuous-deployment/) that describes the process we used to build the website.
Briefly, it makes use of the `R` `blogdown` package, that is a wrapper package creating `hugo` websites. 
We are using `Github Pages` to host the static website, and `Travis CI` to build the website in a stable environment.

We will try to organize a Git RUB someday, and produce this kind of web space! â˜º
