We are a group of young scientists aiming to promote the unseminars culture in Roscoff as a tool to share our knowledge (and ignorance!), experiences and interests around biological research and open science. RUB is strongly inspired by [Heidelberg Unseminars in Bioinformatics](http://www.hub-hub.de/), as well as the [Barcelona Unseminars in Bioinformatics](https://bcnunseminars.wordpress.com), two forums committed to coordinate a meeting point for bioinformaticians to encourage networking in their community.

This project and this website are participant-driven, we encourage you to collaborate! You can do it through our [github](https://github.com/rub-hub) repositories.
